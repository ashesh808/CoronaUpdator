# CoronaUpdator
A simple program which updates the user on coronavirus total cases. This was made with python and the data was taken from worldometer. I used Beautifulsoup for this. This is the 'first practical application' I made, as in I did not feel like refreshing the worldometer page every couple of minutes.
